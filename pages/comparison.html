    <h2>
      Mars, with a diameter of 6790km, is only slightly more than half the size of Earth, which is 12750km in diameter. Note the difference in color between the two planets. Almost 70% of Earth's surface is covered by liquid water. In contrast, Mars now has no liquid water on its surface and is covered with bare rock and dust.
    <br><br>
      At one time, astronomers believed the surface of Mars was crisscrossed by canal systems. This in turn gave rise to speculation that Mars was very much like Earth, capable of supporting life and home to a native civilization. But as human satellites and rovers began to conduct flybys and surveys of the planet, this vision of Mars quickly dissolved, replaced by one in which the Red Planet was a cold, desiccated and lifeless world.
    <br><br>
      However, over the past few decades, scientists have come to learn a great deal about the history of Mars that has altered this view as well. We now know that though Mars may currently be very cold, very dry, and very inhospitable, this wasn’t always the case.
